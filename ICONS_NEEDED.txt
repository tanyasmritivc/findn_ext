ICON FILES NEEDED FOR FINDN AI EXTENSION

The extension requires the following icon files in the 'icons' folder:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon32.png (32x32 pixels) 
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

TEMPORARY SOLUTION:
For testing purposes, you can:
1. Create an 'icons' folder in the extension directory
2. Use any PNG images with the required dimensions
3. Rename them to match the filenames above

DESIGN SUGGESTIONS:
- Use a modern, minimal design
- Colors: Black (#000000) and white (#ffffff) to match the extension theme
- Consider using "AI" text or a network/connection symbol
- Keep it simple and recognizable at small sizes

The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default puzzle piece icon instead.
